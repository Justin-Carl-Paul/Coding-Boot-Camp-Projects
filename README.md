Examples of the projects that I have completed in my Hyperion Development online software engineering boot camp.

## Simple Finance Calculator
The simple finance calculator takes user inputs through the console. It then calculates the interest rate or monthly repayments depending on the users inpout.

## Gerald Hunter of Monsters
Gerald Hunter of Monsters is a simple pygame program. You play as a powerful wizard, Gerald who has to avoid enemies and get the jewel at the end of the level to win the game.
The game has an attractive art style and music.

## Task Manager
The Task manager program allows users to logo onto it's main menu via the console using a unique username and password. The users can then add tasks, assign tasks to user, edit tasks and view specific tasks. Admin users can add new users to the application and also have additional rights that normal users do not.

## Construction Company Project Manager
This is a project manager for a construction company. The task focuses on OOP. The program contains projects, customers, architects and contractors as classes. The user will then manipulate these classes and read and write them to .txt files. The application also generates an invoice for the customer once a project has been finalised.

## e Book Keeper
This is a simple application that allows the user to add books, remove books, update books and search for books on a mySQL database.

## Construction Company Project Manager mySQL
This application is based on the previous construction company project manager and has the same functionality. However,
the application uses a mySQL database to write and read information from and to instead of .txt files.
